A car service Full stack template on vehicle service center. The Backend would be added very soon. The template is posted right here
The existing system consists mainly of a manual method of car wash services. The citizens have to visit the car wash get a token or coupon of the car wash and wait for their turn to get the wash.
This system seems to be a disadvantage to time management and resources of the people entering the car wash. This often leads to disruptions in the car wash and not a proper system exists to make this process easy. The system proposed is to book a car wash through an online portal for easy processing of washing a car without any disruptions or disturbances.
This system allows the user to book a car wash and select the slot timings for the wash mentioning the type of car wash needed, the different type of services required and so on.
The payment is made to do online, so that the hassle-free movement of car wash is done. The objective of the system is to create a method for users to book a service for their vehicle.
The users should be able to select time slots for car washing, select the type of services required, and make a payment so that the process of vehicle service is done in a hassle-free and time managing way.
This system also helps the users or citizens to manage their resources as well, creating a disruption-free environment. 
The project is build mainly upon javascript along with HTML and CSS. The backend used will be django and MySQL.
